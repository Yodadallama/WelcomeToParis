               <p id="blurb">The best part of visiting Paris is, by far, the food. It’s honestly hard to have a really bad meal in Paris. Believe me, I’ve eaten enough that the odds are pretty good that you’ll have some incredible French cuisine without even trying. French culture really prioritizes the appreciation of quality food, and that shows as you’re eating around the city.</p>

               <ol>
                   <li><strong>Acte II</strong>: Make a reservation for this amazing rooftop bar and restaurant to ensure a table with an amazing view. Nestled on top of a seven-story building, Acte II is the best quality barbeque you’ve ever visited, smells of aged beef and freshly grilled lobster, served next to seasonal and locally sourced products means you’ll be overordering. The Japanese chef Masahide Ikuta has worked in some of Paris’ most celebrated kitchens and his Japanese approach to French produce is not to be missed. Plus, from the middle of the trendy Marais, you have a totally different view of Parisian zinc rooftops and the Pompidou Centre. </li>
                   <li><strong>Jòia</strong>: is the second restaurant by Hélène Darroze, who was voted the best female chef in the world. The menu revolves around comfort food from Darroze’s homeland just outside the French Basque Country, with an added touch of global flavors. Roasted chicken from the Landes region is a must try, and so is the fusion of crêpes mille-feuille and matcha. To quench your thirst, you’re in luck: one of Paris’ most unique wine lists is here. All of the vintage wines are made by female winemakers, or vigneronnes. </li>
                   <li><strong>David Toutain</strong>: serves some of the most interesting and boldest food in Paris. Normandy-born Toutain, who also used to work with Alain Passard at Arpège, was awarded his second Michelin star in January 2019. The restaurant’s daily-changing menu is filled with inventive and beautifully presented dishes. The flavors are as unexpected as they are delicious: think grilled eel with black sesame sauce, or Toutain’s signature egg yolk with cumin caramel creme. </li>
